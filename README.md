go backend to support the parallella multicore architecture. 

NOTE: This project ports the march independent parts of ken-cc/gc to go. With that being said, the only extra work left for a self hosting gc is all the platform specific backends. (5g, 6c, 8a, etc) 

If you want to work on that, dont fork this repo. Rather fork github.com/mortdeus/goblin which is the plan9 userspace ported to go.
